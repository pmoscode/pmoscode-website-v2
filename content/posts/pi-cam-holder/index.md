I came around with the idea to access my 3D printer remotely. Until then I had to sit in front of my desktop computer and print via Cura.

Here is how it ended...

I found the *[Octopi project](https://octoprint.org/)* on the internet and ordered a Raspberry Pi 4 on the same day.
After I held everything in my hands I started to build up the "Octopi server".

Octopi has a nice feature: "Timelapse". So you can make a timelapse video of the print.
To get this running I used a Pi Cam, I had bought some time ago. But the question was: How to mount everything?

So, a few clicks later I found this one:

- *[prodals Raspi holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3950698)*

After a few prints I realized that the cam position was not optimal. Both the print head and the bed were moving.
So the timelapse video was too bumpy.

Again, some clicks later I found this:

- *[nobikkos bed mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3721154)*

At the end I made a remix of prodals Raspi holder cam mount and nobikkos bed mount.
So, if you want to print this you need the cam case from prodals Raspi holder.

Here, the *[STL file](misc/Pi_Cam_Holder.stl)*

Here the print from the old bumpy perspective:

{{< video src="/mov/2020/pi_cam_holder/cam_holder.mp4" autoplay="false" >}}

Now, with the new Pi cam mount:

{{< video src="/mov/2020/pi_cam_holder/result.mp4" autoplay="false" >}}

Doesn't look bumpy at all now...
